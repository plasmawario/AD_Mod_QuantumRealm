# Antimatter Dimensions: Quantum Realm

## chapter 1

This mod aims to give the player an all new experience, with themes and inspiration centered around the Standard Model of particles and other related phenomena. You will not be playing any part of the vanilla game. Everything is different.

While this all may sound exciting, i'd also want to make sure to keep your expectations realistic - this has been almost entirely solo-developed by me, and it does share much of the same DNA as the vanilla game. All of the content from Chapter 1 is essentially remixed versions of various parts of the vanilla game. In future chapters, I aim to implement more original ideas and content. Consider this chapter to be the "setting-up" phase for what's to come!

As far as the scope of this project, again, keeping expectations realistic, it most likely won't grow to be as large and as complex as vanilla Antimatter Dimensions when this mod is 100% finished. Again, i'm only one person, while the vanilla game had a pretty decent team. Regardless, i hope that by the end of it, it provides something new and interesting both in itself and as far as other mods go!
